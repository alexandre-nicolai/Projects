2. Face Mask Recognition Project 

Scraped images to create a database (Selenium, BeautyfulSoup) and augmented it			        
Built a CNN model with Keras to identify if a mask is worn and tested it in real time (CV2), achieved a 78% accuracy

3. Sales Growth

Can Sales growth explain abnormal returns? 

Cleaned and merged CRSP and Compustat databases over the period 1967-2020.
Created deciles based on the pourcentage sales in growth over the last 3 years for each stock. 
Then built value_weighted portfolios from each decile and calculated the monthly return, rebalancing at the beginning of each year

Estimated alphas with different benchmarks from Ken French’s website and tested whether the alphas are different across sales growth groups.
